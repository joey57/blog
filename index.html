    <h2>It's never to late</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> Sure, there are more “conventional” age ranges for certain things... but ,who cares People start biking at 6 or 60 years old. People get married at 18 or 80. And age does not determine whether you succeed at, or even enjoy any of these things.It all depends on how you feel, what you want, where you are in life.You are allowed to choose and change your hobbies, careers, environment, lifestyle... whenever you want.Once you free yourself from those arbitrary societal constructs, you give yourself freedom to pursue dance at age 20, 45, 60…</p>
