    <h2>It's Never too late</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> Sure, there are more “conventional” age ranges for certain things... but ,who cares People start biking at 6 or 60 years old. People get married at 18 or 80. And age does not determine whether you succeed at, or even enjoy any of these things.It all depends on how you feel, what you want, where you are in life.You are allowed to choose and change your hobbies, careers, environment, lifestyle... whenever you want.Once you free yourself from those arbitrary societal constructs, you give yourself freedom to pursue dance at age 20, 45, 60…</p>
    <p>A lot of us fear being judged. We're scared of not being able to keep up in a class. We fear just feeling old in a sea of 16 year-old expert dancers!But these are good signs. These are the exact reasons you should start dancing. In The War of Art author Steven Pressfield talks about “Resistance” as the main culprit behind dreams unfollowed and passions abandoned.We resist taking certain opportunities or risks in dance because we are afraid</p>
    <p>The more resistance you feel against something, the more it means to you, and the more you are meant to do it.I mean, if you didn't care, it'd just be another thing you do without much gusto.This resistance to dance will be transformed into motivation, passion, and drive  as soon as you start.</p>

    <h2>Why your Dancing sucks</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> when you're moving around, day to day,you're not holding your breath,you're breathing through everything that you do,and the same goes for dancing. once you start focusing too much on the moves, and getting nervous, and you hold your breath,your movements are gonna look stiff because your body's not flowing the oxygen through your veins. so, the next time you find yourself feeling stiff or cutting your movements off, you know to breathe.</p>
    <p>There's a difference between a singer that can hit all the notes, and a singer that pours their heart and soul into their voice often we think being clean or getting the moves makes someone a good dancer but that can only take you so far.You need to get in your feels. It all goes back to that gut feeling when you first heard that song that made you want to get up and dance that's a feeling, that's a vibe.</p>
    <p>Listen, it is human nature to want to feel validated and as dancers that's even more amplified, because we're natural performers, you know we're sharing a part of ourselves in our dancing and we want people to like what we do.You have to be open to and welcome critique.</p>
